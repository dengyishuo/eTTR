\title{Price Oscillator (PO) Calculation}
\usage{
PO(
  price,
  n_short = 12,
  n_long = 26,
  type = c("difference", "percent"),
  ma_type = c("SMA", "EMA")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{price}{A price series, which can be a vector, time series, or xts object.}

\item{n_short}{The period for the short-term moving average, default is 12.}

\item{n_long}{The period for the long-term moving average, default is 26.}

\item{type}{The type of return value: "difference" for the absolute difference,
"percent" for the percentage difference. Default is "difference".}

\item{ma_type}{The type of moving average, supports "SMA" (Simple Moving Average)
and "EMA" (Exponential Moving Average). Default is "SMA".}
}
\value{
A PO indicator series of the same type as the input price series.
}
\description{
Calculates the Price Oscillator (PO), a momentum indicator that measures the difference
between two moving averages of different periods. It helps identify trends and potential
reversal points in financial markets.
}
\details{
The Price Oscillator (PO) measures momentum by calculating the difference between
a short-term and a long-term moving average of prices. A positive PO value indicates
upward momentum, while a negative value suggests downward momentum.

\examples{
# Demonstrate PO calculation with random data
set.seed(123)
price_data <- xts::xts(rnorm(100, 100, 5), order.by = Sys.Date() - 100:1)
# Calculate PO with default parameters (difference form)
po_diff <- PO(price_data)
# Calculate PO in percentage form
po_percent <- PO(price_data, type = "percent")
# Calculate PO using EMA
po_ema <- PO(price_data, ma_type = "EMA")

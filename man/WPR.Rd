\title{William's \%R}
\usage{
WPR(HLC, n = 14, scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{HLC}{Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
High-Low-Close prices.  If only a univariate series is given, it will be
used.  See details.}

\item{n}{Number of periods to use.}

\item{scale}{Scale the result to be between 0 and -100.}
}
\value{
A object of the same class as \code{HLC} or a vector (if
\code{try.xts} fails) containing the William's \%R values.
}
\description{
William's \% R.
}
\details{
If an High-Low-Close series is provided, the indicator is calculated using
the high/low values.  If a vector is provided, the calculation only uses that
series.
}
\note{
The William's \%R calculation is similar to stochastics' fast \%K,
and the result of \code{WPR} is equal to \code{1-fastK}.

The value for William's \%R will be 0.5 whenever the highest high and
lowest low are the same over the last \code{n} periods.

William's \%R is usually scaled to be between 0 and -100, which is not what
\code{WPR} returns by default. Set \code{scale = TRUE} to return the result
with the usual scaling.
}
\examples{

data(ttrc)
hlc <- ttrc[, c("High", "Low", "Close")]
stochOsc <- stoch(hlc)
stochWPR <- WPR(hlc)

# WPR is a transformation of stochastics' fastK
all.equal(stochWPR, 1 - stochOsc[, "fastK"]) # TRUE

# WPR converted to the usual scaling between 0 and -100
scaledWPR <- WPR(hlc, scale = TRUE)

plot(tail(stochOsc[, "fastK"], 100),
  type = "l",
  main = "Fast \%K and Williams \%R", ylab = "",
  ylim = range(cbind(stochOsc, stochWPR), na.rm = TRUE)
)
lines(tail(stochWPR, 100), col = "blue")
lines(tail(1 - stochWPR, 100), col = "red", lty = "dashed")
